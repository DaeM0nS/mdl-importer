MDL Importer
============

This is a simple Blender addon that allows the importing of WarCraft 3 model meshes.

Install
-------

Install it by going to 
```
File -> User Preferences -> Install from File..
```
in Blender, and then point it at the mdl-importer.py

Usage
-----

This imports .mdl files, so you will have to extract any .mdx files from Blizzard .mpq archives and then convert them into .mdl for the time.

Once the addon is installed, you can import by going to
```
File -> Import -> MDL (.mdl)
```
and then select your model file from there.
